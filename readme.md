## <p align='center'>Welcome to the BitBar Appium Sample Script!</p>

This script runs as a Client-Side Appium Android script to BitBar.

We will use the Wikipedia app for testing. This is an extremely simple script that launches the Wikipedia app, searches for 'SmartBear' and verfies the description of the first search result.

Start by uploading the .APK to your Files Library in BitBar and retrieve the File ID once it has been uploaded.

Next, enter your API Key on line 10, setup the capabilites to match the desired device and enter the file ID of the uploaded APK to line 11.

[The BitBar Capabilities Creator can be found HERE.](https://cloud.bitbar.com/#public/capabilities-creator)

Now you may launch the script! 

Happy Testing!
